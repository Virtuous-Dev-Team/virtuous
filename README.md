# Virtuous

This is the correct repo to clone, moved repos so that it is connected to a dev account

This year we will be updating a mobile application called Virtuous. This application will mainly serve the legal industry and will give a user a chance to report what virtues they did or didnâ€™t use. By using our app daily they will be able to observe their progress over time as we share their data and previous reports.

**Main Branch** - Should be for only tested code and production use

**Develop Branch** - Updated code that needs testing and will eventually be promoted to main branch. This code should be the most updated amoung the team.

**To run app:**
- Clone repository and you should be on the main folder: Virtue Tracker

- Step 0 (optional/recommended): You can open an mobile emulator

- Step 1: flutter run

**To test screens** 
- navigate to -> main.dart
- Currently we are using GoRouter to handle our routes so we are automatically sent to either signIn or home. If you want to test a screen comment out the MyApp widget and uncomment the one above which will navigate to whichever screen you want.

**RiverPod controllers (api controllers)**

- To create new controllers read this resource, we use a generator that will generate the AsyncNotifierProvider after saving the file. Link: https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-riverpod-generator/

**Flutter packages** 

- All flutter packages used can be found in pubsec.yaml, to look at their documentation you can search for the package here: https://pub.dev/
